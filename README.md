# Gremlin
Gemini browser for the terminal

# Implemented features
1. Basic text formatting according to the text/gemini specification. (Headings, sub-headings, links and more)
2. Moving up and down the browsing history.
3. Redirects from links and separate scrolling for links (Maybe this is an anti-feature?)

# Things to be completed soon
1. Improvements in UI/UX:
   Provide visual feedback when a background process (eg. making a request over the network) is happening.
   Create a help menu
   Provide visual feedback about what command you just used.
   Use tui popup input widgets
   
2. Low priority bugs (crash when gemini space has no links, performance issues when scrolling a lot)
3. Trust on first use (TOFU) for TLS certificates.
